      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a multipotentialite with a wide range of interests and I have finally discovered a career path that combines a bunch of my interests. I am currently trying to utilise these qualities as effectively as possible in this field to create the best user experience.</p>
      <p>In short, I believe in the phrase;</p>
      <p>"A jack of all trades is a Master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one".</p>

    <h2>Everything I do when I'm not working</h2>
    <p>I have always liked learning new things, which is why I have many interests and strive to make time to try things I find fascinating.</p>
    <p>So when I am not working or when I get bored of working on the same thing for too long, I sketch, sing, learn Mandarin/Korean/Spanish, browse on Instagram, try to cook something new, learn how to braid my hair in new ways, or do the 50 other things that increase my serotonin.</p>
    <p>I also like volunteering and was a teaching volunteer at U&I and AIESEC. So that is one fixed thing that I would dedicate my time to if I find a good opportunity.</p>
    <p>One more thing — I like making new friends. So, maybe say hi while you are here :)</p>
